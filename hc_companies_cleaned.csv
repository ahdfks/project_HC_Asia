FOBI uses light source and filter that are optimized for Green fluorescence and NIR to distinguish background and signal without preprocessing.  Diffused LED light makes the results more reliable as it reduces variations in position. Not only highly sensitive images but also movies can be acquired by FOBI. Its simple design and program allows ease of use and quick acquisition of data.  The second item is Gel-doc, NaBI. EtBr and UV have been used in laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis. However, it has been shown that EtBr is toxic and  potential mutagen. Also, UV can damage DNA sample and UV radiation is harmful. NaBI is optimized for excitation of alternative reagent to EtBr with 470nm Blue LED replacing UV light. Its compact size helps make better use of a space in the laboratory.

Hospital’s slow result turns out to be absolutely insufficient for the patient of diabetes.Inaccurate measurement of blood glucose level may result in wrong and dangerous remedy action which may even cause the lost of lives.   In light of such need for daily and easy measurement, HMD Biomedical concentrates on developing blood glucose measurement technology since the first day of establishment.   10 years of dedication we have spent in this technology makes us the leading company in this field. Our patents cover from meter, test strip even to lancing device. IC, circuit board… are all in-house technology and production. Quality thus can be controlled to the highest level.   Today, we can make 500,000 strips and we export to 5 continents on earth. The growth in business is just the outcome of the continuous improvement in our technology and quality.

(hereinafter referred to as ""Kongxin-KY"", stock code: 6617) was established in 2014. It upholds the concept of ""innovation, professionalism, integrity and care"". It is a company founded in the United States, developed in China, A cancer drug development company organized and managed in Taiwan. The company's core technology ""Minimally Invasive Targeted Tumor Ablation"" is the latest technology in the field of minimally invasive treatment and can be directly applied to the treatment of various solid tumors. Gongxin-KY's core technology breaks away from traditional cancer treatment thinking, uses minimally invasive intervention to eliminate tumors, and directly injects drugs with PTS as the main active ingredient on the tumor to ablate the tumor at a specific site. The advantage is that PTS drugs can be concentrated on the tumor site, and the PTS drugs are highly selective to the tumor, so the impact on the normal tissues around the tumor is very slight, and it has a high degree of safety. The KY-KY team is confident that PTS ""Minimally Invasive Targeted Tumor Ablation Therapy"" drugs will be a new choice for directly eliminating tumor cancer cells in the future. The following are the new drug products being developed by Gongxin-KY: (1) The new drug PTS302 for the treatment of lung cancer has been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the State Food and Drug Administration of China and has entered the review stage. After this stage is passed, PTS302 is smooth Obtained China Lung Cancer New Drug Certificate (2) PTS100, a new liver cancer drug, has been implemented in the Phase II clinical trial of liver cancer in National Taiwan University Hospital (3) PTS-02 for the treatment of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma has obtained the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) orphan drug qualification , Plans to submit an IND application to the US FDA in 2019 (4) for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion PTS500, and plans to submit an IND application to the US FDA in 2019. In addition to researching and developing new anti-cancer drugs, KY-KY is also actively developing other drugs that are not satisfied by the market. Therefore, it plans to set up a pilot laboratory in compliance with cGMP regulations in the Wugu Industrial Park in New Taipei City to accelerate the optimization of new drug prescription development and establish animals The trial and mass production of APIs is currently stepping up the decoration and verification of related hardware equipment. It is expected to be completed and moved in in the first half of 2019, which will increase the overall new drug R&D capacity of Gongxin-KY and shorten the development timeline of PTS new drugs. The discussion on the development of PTS as a new drug began in the 1980s. After years of research, the inventors Dr. Wu Yizhuang and Dr. Shi Jiashun established PTS International Inc. in Texas, USA in 2000, and at the same time established Pro Biochemical Development Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jian Dakang New Drug Development Co., Ltd. (abbreviated as Beijian Company) carries out various pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials. At present, the Phase III clinical trial of PTS applied to non-small cell lung cancer has been completed, the application for registration of Class 1 new drug has been submitted, and it is under priority review by the Chinese FDA. In order to integrate the value chain of new drug development, the US subsidiary PTS International Inc. and its partner Tianjin Hongri Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. established Tianjin Hongrijian Dakang Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as Tianjin Hongjian) to be responsible for the drug registration and registration of PTS new drugs in China. Manufacturing production. In view of the maturity and energy of Taiwan's R&D environment and the consideration of global layout, PTS International Inc. established Gongxin Pharmaceutical and Gongxin Holdings in Taiwan in 2014, and completed the integration and reorganization in December 2015.
